    <p>Chelsea returned to training at Cobham today as Mauricio Pochettino and his players began working towards Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.The Blues take on Liverpool under the famous arch and there is the potential for the first trophy of the Pochettino era at Stamford Bridge to be claimed.On Tuesday, the Chelsea squad reunited at Cobham for the first time following the 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Saturday evening, a result that extended our unbeaten run away from home to three games in all competitions.</p>

    <p>Raheem Sterling was one of those being put through his paces this morning at our training base, and the England international will be hoping to add on his fine goal at the Etihad this weekend.The forward spent time at Liverpool earlier in his career, making 129 appearances for the Reds between 2011 and 2015.But it was just a stone's throw away from Wembley, in the London borough of Brent, that Sterling honed his skills as a boy.And playing on home turf has previously brought the best out of the 29-year-old, who struck three goals at the national stadium on England's run to the Euro 2020 final.</p>

    <p>Chelsea Under-21s head coach Mark Robinson was proud of his players' second-half performance in their 2-0 victory away at Leeds United in Premier League 2.The Blues travelled north attempting to bounce back after a narrow defeat to a strong PSV Eindhoven side in the Premier League International Cup at Stamford Bridge the previous Thursday.And Robinson's team showed no sign of a hangover with a fast start at Thorpe Arch. Zak Sturge forced the first opening down the left wing in the early minutes, only for Leeds' Charlie Cresswell to make a last-ditch clearance.We didn't have to wait long, however, for the breakthrough, which arrived via Leo Castledine.Michael Golding was the architect as he broke forward from midfield before his cross was deflected into the path of Castledine, who coolly found the corner of the net with a curled finish.</p>
